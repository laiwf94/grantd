# authz roadmap, November 2026 to October 2027

## Vision

By October 2027 authz is one Go identity and access platform, built from grantd, wicket and toolgate, that does three jobs in one small binary: it signs people and agents in (OpenID Connect and SAML provider and relying party, passkeys, MFA, flows, federation, SCIM, organizations), it decides what they may do (Zanzibar-style relationships with caveats, attributes, every query, consistency tokens, a disk store, PostgreSQL, MySQL and CockroachDB, a Raft-replicated and sharded cluster), and it governs what AI agents do through MCP (default-deny tool policy, approvals, data-flow labels, sandboxes, a credential vault, a tamper-evident audit chain). It targets parity with Okta, Auth0, Microsoft Entra ID, Ping Identity, Keycloak, Zitadel, Ory and FusionAuth on identity, with Okta FGA, AuthZed SpiceDB, OpenFGA, Permit.io and Cerbos on authorization, and with Kong AI Gateway, Azure API Management, Cloudflare MCP portals, agentgateway and IBM ContextForge on agent traffic, and goes further where only a combined product can: the gateway and the MCP proxy ask the authorization engine in process, agents are directory principals with owners and delegated tokens, and every sign-in, permission change and tool call lands in one Merkle-provable audit chain. It stays lightweight: one static binary and an image under 25 MB, idle memory under 30 MB, cold start under 100 ms, check p99 under 5 ms at 100 million relationships, forward-auth and MCP added p99 under 1 ms, published in a reproducible benchmark against the leaders, re-measured every quarter and held by a CI regression gate. The server is Go on the standard library first; the admin console and the JavaScript SDK are TypeScript.

Benchmark products: Okta, Auth0, Microsoft Entra ID, Ping Identity, Keycloak, Zitadel, Ory, FusionAuth, Authentik and oauth2-proxy for identity; Okta FGA, AuthZed SpiceDB, OpenFGA, Permit.io, Cerbos, OPA and Oso for authorization; Kong AI Gateway, Azure API Management, Cloudflare MCP server portals, agentgateway, IBM ContextForge, Docker MCP Gateway and Lasso for agent traffic.

Footprint and speed targets, published in BENCHMARKS.md from week 5, re-measured in weeks 22, 34, 44 and 52 and enforced by the CI gate: image under 25 MB, idle RSS under 30 MB with all subcommands, cold start under 100 ms, check p99 under 5 ms at 100 million relationships, forward-auth p99 under 1 ms, MCP added p99 under 1 ms, 64 MB resident with 100,000 sessions.

## How the year runs

Every week ships three features in parallel, one per track, each run as one half-day cloud task per day (seven tasks a week, the last an end-to-end demo plus docs):

- **authn** (from wicket): sign-in, the identity provider, OIDC and SAML, passkeys, MFA, sessions, directories, SCIM, tenants, admin access and the console.
- **authz** (from grantd): relationships, schema, checks, lookups, storage, clustering, and the platform pieces that sit under storage: replication, Raft, backups, encryption, upgrades, benchmarks and SDKs.
- **agents** (from toolgate): the MCP gateway, agent identity and delegation, tool policy, approvals, guardrails, sandboxes, and the platform pieces that sit around events: audit, event delivery, observability, releases, rate limits and metering.

The three features of a week are planned to touch different packages, apart from the week 1 and 2 moves. Where one track needs another's work, the dependency points backwards in time (for example agents week 5 uses the in-process engine from authz week 3 and the CEL engine from authz week 4).

Dependencies: the server is standard library first. Named exceptions, each justified in the week that adds it: beevik/etree and russellhaering/goxmldsig for SAML XML signatures (carried from wicket, week 1), golang.org/x/crypto for argon2id and SSH certificates (authn weeks 8 and 51), jcmturner/gokrb5 for Kerberos (authn week 43, confined to one package), and HashiCorp's terraform-plugin-framework in the separate terraform-provider-authz module (authn week 18). jonboulle/clockwork is removed in week 2. PostgreSQL, MySQL, protobuf, gRPC framing, OTLP, ACME, LDAP, RADIUS, WebAuthn and the object store client are written in-house. The console uses Lit and Vite; the TypeScript SDK has no runtime dependency.

## Weeks 1 and 2: one product without behaviour change

The rename of grantd to authz and the subtree import of wicket and toolgate (full history, own go.mod files) are the starting point. Go's internal package rule stops the root binary from importing wicket/internal or toolgate/internal, so week 1 moves the trees rather than wrapping them.

- **Week 1, all three tracks:** one go.mod at the root; grantd code to internal/authz, wicket to internal/authn, toolgate to internal/agents, with a script that rewrites only import specs; one `authz` binary whose subcommands (serve, gateway, mcp, fakeidp, mcpfake) keep the old flags, environment variables and config files; one CI gate replacing three workflows. Proof of no behaviour change: scripts/testbody-diff.sh shows zero changed lines in any test body outside import blocks, test counts per package match the pre-merge counts, and golden responses (wicket) and recorded decisions (toolgate) diff empty.
- **Week 2, split by track:** authz extracts the storage log, the metrics registry and the HTTP server; authn extracts the key service, JOSE, sealed cookies and one config schema with live reload; agents extracts the audit log, structured logging with correlation IDs and the rate limiter. Each old crash, rotation and limiter test passes against the shared package unchanged.
- **Week 3 onward:** integration that only a combined product can do. The gateway and the MCP proxy call the engine in process (authz week 3, authn week 4, agents week 5), agents get identities and delegated tokens from authn (weeks 15 and 16), and every event lands in one audit chain (agents week 3).

## Shared capabilities, owned once

The three earlier plans each planned the items below. Each now appears once, in the track named; the freed slots went to new parity work (Shared Signals, workload identity federation, conditional access, verifiable credentials, Kerberos, LDAP and RADIUS front-ends, push MFA, data filtering, Cedar and Rego import, .NET and Ruby SDKs, schema modules, Cross App Access, retrieval authorization, LLM routing, code mode, delegation chains and more).

## Next year

- Spanner as a datastore.
- SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001 or FedRAMP attestations for hosted mode, which are organisational rather than code work.
- Native iOS and Android authenticator apps for push MFA beyond the web app authenticator.
- An application catalog in the thousands rather than 40 templates.
- Browser-based remote access to RDP, SSH and VNC sessions.
- PHP and Rust SDKs, and a packaged JetBrains plugin for the schema language.
- Full Rego coverage beyond the documented subset.
- HSM-native signing through PKCS#11.
- Identity proofing with document verification.
- A multi-operator managed control plane beyond single-operator hosted mode.
