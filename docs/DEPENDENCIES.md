# Dependencies

authz is one Go module, `github.com/laiwf94/authz`, built on the standard
library first. Every module listed in `go.mod` has to be justified here: what
it is for, why the standard library is not enough, where it is confined and
when, if ever, it goes away. A change that adds a requirement without a
section in this file does not pass review.

The module targets Go 1.27.3 (`go` directive in `go.mod`), the same version
grantd, wicket and toolgate each used before the merge, so the toolchain did
not move with the tree.

## Direct requirements

| Module | Version | Used by | Since | Planned exit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| github.com/beevik/etree | v1.8.1 | SAML (internal/authn/saml, internal/authn/fakeidp) | wicket, carried in week 1 | none planned |
| github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig | v1.6.1 | SAML signature verification and signing (same packages) | wicket, carried in week 1 | none planned |
| github.com/jonboulle/clockwork | v0.5.0 | one call in internal/authn/saml/signature.go | wicket, carried in week 1 | removed in week 2 |

grantd (now the module root) and toolgate brought no third-party
requirements. The three requirements above are exactly wicket's, at the
versions wicket pinned; `go.sum` is wicket's `go.sum` unchanged.

### github.com/beevik/etree

An XML element tree with namespace-aware lookups and serialisation that
keeps attribute order and namespace declarations. SAML assertions are
signed with XML Signature over exclusive canonical XML, which has to be
computed over the document as received, including namespace prefixes that
`encoding/xml` rewrites or drops on a round trip. `encoding/xml` has no tree
model and cannot reproduce the input faithfully, so it cannot feed a
canonicaliser. etree is also the tree type goxmldsig operates on.

Confinement: imported only by the SAML packages. Documents reach it through
`parseStrict` (internal/authn/saml/xml.go), which first bounds size and
depth and rejects DTDs and entity declarations, so etree never sees an
input the strict parser has not accepted.

### github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig

XML Signature (XML-DSig) verification and signing: exclusive C14N, the
enveloped-signature transform, digest and signature checks against a
trusted certificate set. Getting canonicalisation or reference resolution
wrong is how signature-wrapping attacks against SAML service providers
work, so authz uses a library that is widely deployed, actively maintained
and has been through public security review and advisories, instead of a
new implementation. wicket narrows it further: the accepted signature
algorithms are an allow list of RSA and ECDSA with SHA-256 or stronger,
the signed reference must name the element being trusted, and the attack
suite in internal/authn/saml covers wrapping, comment injection and
duplicated IDs.

Confinement: imported only by the SAML packages.

### github.com/jonboulle/clockwork

A fake clock. goxmldsig checks certificate validity against a clock it
takes as `*dsig.Clock`, whose only constructor that accepts a fixed time
needs a `clockwork.Clock`. wicket uses it in one place
(`dsig.NewFakeClock(clockwork.NewFakeClockAt(now))`) so that signature
checks use the same `now` as the rest of assertion validation.

Exit: week 2 (authn track) introduces the platform's injectable clock and
removes this requirement from `go.mod`, with the SAML suite passing
unchanged as the proof that certificate lifetimes are still checked
against the assertion's `now`.

## Indirect and test-only modules

`go list -m all` also shows github.com/stretchr/testify,
github.com/davecgh/go-spew, github.com/pmezard/go-difflib,
gopkg.in/yaml.v3, github.com/kr/pretty and gopkg.in/check.v1. They are
requirements of goxmldsig's own tests and of testify. None of authz's
packages imports them and none is compiled into a binary; testify,
go-spew, go-difflib and yaml.v3 are recorded in `go.sum` only so the
module graph can be verified.

## Checking

`go mod tidy` must leave `go.mod` and `go.sum` unchanged, `go list -deps
./...` must show no module outside the table above, and govulncheck
runs over the whole module in CI.
